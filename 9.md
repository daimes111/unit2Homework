#HackerRank HW

##Question 1 *MiniMax Sum*
```
function miniMaxSum(arr) {
    // Write your code here
    arr = arr.sort((a,b) => a - b)
    
    const sum = arr.reduce((a, total) => a + total, 0)
    console.log(sum-arr[arr.length -1], sum - arr[0])
}
```
>For this problem I originally thought of looping through and counting all but one, but immediately realized that would take too much time when thinking of Big 0 (o(n^2)). Then I realized, I only want the max and min so there would be no need to count the in betweens. That was when I realize I could sort from biggest to smallest or vice versa, find the sum of all and subtract the biggest one to get the min and the smallest one to get the max (2o(n) aka o(n))


##Question 2 *Plus Minus*
```
ffunction plusMinus(arr) {
    // Write your code here
    let plus = 0
    let minus = 0
    let zero = 0
    let length = arr.length
    arr.forEach(i => {
        if (i < 0) neg++
        if (i > 0) pos++
        if (i === 0) zero++

    })
    console.log((plus / length).toFixed(6))
    console.log((minus / length).toFixed(6))
    console.log((zero / length).toFixed(6))
}
```
>This one seemed fairly easy to me. This one needed to loop through the array and count based on if it was more, less, or equal to zero. There is only one loop needed so I would put this as o(n). For bigger pieces of data, my thought would be to filter and the somehow start count with the zeros and split the loop up to check above and below 0. 

##Question 3 *Time Conversion*
```
function timeConversion(s) {
    // Write your code here
    let amPm = s[s.length -2] + s[s.length-1]
    let hour = s[0] + s[1]
    
    if (hour == 12) hour = '00'
    if (amPm === "PM") hour = parseInt(hour) + 12
    for (let i=2; i<s.length - 2; i++){
        hour+= s[i]
    }
    return hour

}
```
>For this problem, we did it in class and I rememebered it pretty well. I needed to use both figure out the hour and the use the pm to add 12 to what that came with. Once the hour was done, it was just needed to add the rest of the time in with a simple loop. 0(n) notation
